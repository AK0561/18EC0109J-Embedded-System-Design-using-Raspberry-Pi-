## Introduction

Raspberry Pi is a versatile single-board computer that's widely used for embedded systems development. It offers GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, which can be controlled and programmed to interface with various sensors, actuators, and devices. This repository provides a collection of experiments and source code samples that cover a range of embedded system topics.
